# SIFs 
##### Searching In Frames 
Our graduation project at the first term in the forth grade on my faculty 

# What is the SIFs
Have you ever searched in a video?
Sure, we all searched for a video before, but we didn't look for something in a video like a word, a picture, a sound, or an object inside a video, So we decided to produce a software that does these features.
